Hey! Glad to see you again. There's not a ton to talk about today so this post will just be some graphs - the same definitions and disclaimers from day one apply here as well.

# Day Two
Here's the part where I confess to my sins - I was asleep for most of the day, but I did stick around for a good 5-6 hours in the latter half of the day. This is also coincidentally the busiest time of the day, as people are hopping on after finishing up work and such.

Regardless - over the course of day two, I logged a total of **1,747 characters**, with 697 of those characters being characters I hadn't previously seen.

Impressive!

## Graphs
As with yesterday, these are a bit difficult to read since they're so small. If you middle-click on the images, it'll open them in a new tab and will be **much** more readable.

These graphs only include characters that were seen during day two. After the event concludes, I'll post some aggregate data from all characters seen over the course of the event.

### Character Gender by Class
This one is still a bit messed up - my tools are unfortunately a bit jank, so you'll just have to deal with this for now. ❤️❤️

### Misc Graphs
Like yesterday, I also have graphs showing the number of each class per race. There's far too many to list here, so I'm planning on rounding them up at the end of the event for one big super-post. If you're *really* interested in seeing these graphs *right now*, however, you can.
- Simply navigate to `https://lore.ghst.tools/img/08-05-24-graphs/Classes_<RaceNameHere>.png` and you'll be able to see the data.
    - The race naming is in title case, so `Highmountain Tauren` becomes `HighmountainTauren`, `Mag'har Orc` becomes `MagharOrc`, and so on. Play around with it if you don't get it immediately.
    - Also `Undead/Forsaken` -> `Scourge` (Scourge is the internal name for the race)
