Hey! Glad to see you. I know this has taken me a bit longer than I anticipated to get put together, but I wanted to ensure my data was as accurate as possible to avoid straight up lying to everyone.

# Summary
After putting all of the data together and cleaning it up as best I could, I've ended up with some fun totals for everyone.

**Before using or posting this data in any official capacity, please read the disclaimers at the bottom of the page.**

## Cumulative Count By Phase
First, let's see how many characters I logged for each event phase. It's important to note that these numbers are just the number of characters I logged during any given phase of the event. Because of this, you can't simply add up the numbers and say 'this is the total attendance'. I'll have that number for you later.
- Preshow: **845** characters
- Opening Ceremony: **1,547** characters
    - This is from 30 minutes before the ceremony start up to 30 minutes after the ceremony end
- After Opening Ceremony: **1,481** characters
- Day Two: **1,747** characters
- Day Three: **811** characters
    - I attended fairly early this day and did not stay very late, hence the lower number. Most traffic is later in the evening.
- Day Four: I slept through this entire day, **0** characters
- Day Five: **1,239** characters
- Day Six: **1,552** characters
- Closing Ceremony: **912** characters
- After Closing Ceremony: **995** characters
    - This includes the Wonderlight Ball

## New Characters By Phase
Now, a 'new character' is one that I had not previously logged. This metric essentially says 'how many characters attended on this day that did not attend previously'. This helps to model the 'momentum' of the event.

The phases used here are the same as above, but are only counting characcters not previously seen.
- Preshow: **845** characters
- Opening Ceremony: **770** characters
- After Opening Ceremony: **453** characters
- Day Two: **697** characters
- Day Three: **226** characters
- Day Four: I slept through this entire day, **0** characters
- Day Five: **393** characters
- Day Six: **446** characters
- Closing Ceremony: **59** characters
- After Closing Ceremony: **141** characters

## Totals

Some of the data is a bit messy, so getting an *exact* count is not trivial. After doing some cleanup, we arrive at our final total character count.

The total number of characters counted over the week of ToA is **4,449** characters!

## Graphs
Now, everyone's favorite part. Graphs! I know some of these are probably hard to read since they're so small, but this is the best I can do. Sorry!

If you middle-click on the images, it'll open them in a new tab and will be **much** more readable.

Some graphs may have total numbers that don't actually line up with the values seen on the bars - in such a case, ignore the number in the title.

### Races
These are all the races seen during the week of ToA. Blue bars are Alliance races, red bars are Horde, and white bars are for races that can be on either faction.

### Classes

### Character Gender by Class
This one is purely for fun. It shows the number of each character gender / body type seen per class.

### Misc Graphs
On top of the graphs shown above, I also have graphs showing the number of each class per race. There's far too many to list here, so I'm planning on rounding them up at the end of the event for one big super-post. If you're *really* interested in seeing these graphs *right now*, however, you can.
- Simply navigate to `https://lore.ghst.tools/img/08-14-24-graphs/Classes_<RaceNameHere>.png` and you'll be able to see the data.
    - The race naming is in title case, so `Highmountain Tauren` becomes `HighmountainTauren`, `Mag'har Orc` becomes `MagharOrc`, and so on. Play around with it if you don't get it immediately.
    - Also `Undead/Forsaken` -> `Scourge` (Scourge is the internal name for the race)

## Transmog
Now here's something new for this year. On top of collecting population data, I've also been collecting people's transmogs. This allows me to compile a list of the most popular appearances per slot.

I'm not a hundred percent sure that this was all collected properly, since it's still very much experimental. However, I figured I'd show the people what they want regardless.

In order to get this post out and also not fill this post with too many images, I'll go over the most popular appearances in another post. Stay tuned!

### Disclaimer
The integrity of the collected data is *not* perfect. During the opening ceremony I experienced multiple disconnects, which could disrupt the addon's ability to accurately track characters (however, I think it's robust enough to handle this just fine).

Most importantly, the data collection is from the perspective of **my** characters on Moonguard Alliance. This means that Horde representation and off-realm characters may appear in lower numbers than they would in the real world.

Additionally, it's important to remember that I am counting unique *characters*, not *players*. From my point of view, it's impossible to tell which character belongs to which player, so the best I can do is count unique characters and make the distinction.
