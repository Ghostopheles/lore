Last year, I built an addon specifically designed to count the number of characters I encountered over the course of the weeklong Tournament of Ages event. In 2023, I logged 1,893 unique characters during the opening ceremony.

This year, I've upgraded my addon substantially and I'm back with even more data, and even cooler graphs. I've also collected transmog info, so you may even see a breakdown of the most popular transmog items.

### Definitions
Because we're dealing with data here, I feel like it's responsible to define some terms I'll use throughout this post and future recaps.

This year, I'm tracking character population by event phase. I've broken the event down into nine phases.
- `PRESHOW`: This phase was the day of opening, but *before* the opening ceremony had officially started.
- `OPENING`: The opening is defined as the hour that the opening ceremony was scheduled for (7pm-8pm Central Time) plus thirty minutes before and after. So in reality this is 6:30pm-8:30pm.
- `DAY_ONE`: Anything after 8:30pm but before midnight.
- `DAY_X`: Phases for each day, up until the last day of the event.

When I talk about phases, there'll be two different types of data points I'll talk about. The number of *new* characters seen per phase, and the total number of characters seen per phase.
- "New characters per phase" relates to characters that had not been previously logged. This point is intended to help map out the 'momentum' of the event over the course of the week.
- "Total number of characters per phase" is just the number of characters that were seen by the addon during that phase of the event. Each phase is counted separately, so the same character can be counted in multiple phases.

### Disclaimer
The integrity of the collected data is *not* perfect. During the opening ceremony I experienced multiple disconnects, which could disrupt the addon's ability to accurately track characters (however, I think it's robust enough to handle this just fine).

Most importantly, the data collection is from the perspective of **my** characters on Moonguard Alliance. This means that Horde representation and off-realm characters may appear in lower numbers than they would in the real world.

Additionally, it's important to remember that I am counting unique *characters*, not *players*. From my point of view, it's impossible to tell which character belongs to which player, so the best I can do is count unique characters and make the distinction.

# The Opening Ceremony and Day One
As always, the opening went... mostly smoothly! Lag was expected, as were DCs - these things tend to happen when you pack over a thousand players into one bubble within a single shard. Unfortunately, this year there was a bit of noise created by sharding being enabled (presumably by accident) in the zone. In the past, Blizzard has disabled sharding in Icecrown for this event.

But after fighting through the servers will to survive, the show was still as spectacular as always. They even managed to get the fireworks synced up pretty damn well considering the 3-5 second delay on spell casts.

And now, for some numbers. Over the course of the opening ceremony (as defined above), **my addon logged 1,547 unique characters** in the area. That's a ton! It's not unusual to have this many players in one place in the normal game, but it *is* unusual to have them all in a single shard. And it was pretty damn impressive to see so many people hanging out together, enjoying life and simply existing in this massive, shared community.

I also logged 1,481 characters that stuck around after the opening ceremony had concluded, this is counted under the `DAY_ONE` phase.

During the preshow phase, I logged 845 characters, and the **grand total for the entire day was 2,231 unique characters**.

## Graphs
Now, everyone's favorite part. Graphs! I know some of these are probably hard to read since they're so small, but this is the best I can do. Sorry!

If you middle-click on the images, it'll open them in a new tab and will be **much** more readable.

### Races
These are all the races seen during day one of Tournament of Ages. Blue bars are Alliance races, red bars are Horde, and white bars are for races that can be on either faction.

### Classes
A graph of the number of each class that was logged during the first day.

### Character Gender by Class
This one is purely for fun. It shows the number of each character gender / body type seen per class.

(yes I know it's a bit messed up, I'll fix it for tomorrow)

### Misc Graphs
On top of the graphs shown above, I also have graphs showing the number of each class per race. There's far too many to list here, so I'm planning on rounding them up at the end of the event for one big super-post. If you're *really* interested in seeing these graphs *right now*, however, you can.
- Simply navigate to `https://lore.ghst.tools/img/08-04-24-graphs/Classes_<RaceNameHere>.png` and you'll be able to see the data.
    - The race naming is in title case, so `Highmountain Tauren` becomes `HighmountainTauren`, `Mag'har Orc` becomes `MagharOrc`, and so on. Play around with it if you don't get it immediately.
    - Also `Undead/Forsaken` -> `Scourge` (Scourge is the internal name for the race)

# Remarks
As always, day one was amazing. Got to see plenty of interesting characters, tons of people, and the vibe was just super positive. And that's the kind of thing that these events are great at doing. They let you forget the stress and anxiety present in the real world and hang out in a fantasy world for a few hours, doing whatever it is that makes you happy. And I think it's important for everyone to have that kind of opportunity to escape from real-life every once in a while.

I feel like people these days are far too caught up in finding reasons to hate things or hate one another - life is so much better when you just focus on what makes you happy and keep your thoughts positive.

Anyways, I'll see y'all tomorrow for another recap, have a great Tournament of Ages! ❤️❤️
